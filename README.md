[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)](https://github.com/qtrrb/pymd/blob/main/LICENSE)

pymd is a tool library that enables you to create Markdown documents with embedded Python code, results, and plots. Say goodbye to static documents and embrace dynamic, data-driven storytelling.

## Installation

```sh
git clone github.com/qtrrb/pymd
cd pymd
pip install .
```

## Usage 

```sh
pymd example.pymd
cat example.md
```

## Why use this over x?

- Python Markdown documents can be worked on in any text editor such as vim, without plugins and the use of the web browser.
- Will work out of the box with tools such as pandoc, it doesn't implement any superfluous conversion tools, it is as barebones as it needs to be.
- Perfect for Python-only people, no need to install a new language and libraries such as reticulate to use rmarkdown with Python.
